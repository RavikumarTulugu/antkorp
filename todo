All project level todos are documented here 
i) exceptionalize all the C++ code and handle the exceptions accordingly. 
ii) logging support should be extensive and should be selectable basing on 
	module and level.
iii) selective notification of errors to the user interface, errors can be 
 	filtered or modified before throwing them to user interface.
iv) convert from json to bson or some other format which has support for binary data 
	to avoid the base64 mess. Atleast we can get rid of base64 in fmgr and dstores. 
v) Create a user for akorp on the host system and run daemons with that privilige.
   set the setuid bit of all the daemons and executables so that priviliges can be 
   escalated or dropped basing on need.
vi) try to see if we can use cjson instead of pure lua json , to increase the speed 
	of luacode.
